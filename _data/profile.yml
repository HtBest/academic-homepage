  <p>
      I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at UMass Amherst, advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Cameron Musco</a>.
      Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at UNSW, where I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://serggasp.github.io">Serge Gaspers</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=cBUn3E8AAAAJ&hl=en">Simon Mackenzie</a> and worked as a research assistant with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/">Haris Aziz</a> and <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/jiaojiao-jiang">Jiaojiao Jiang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      My research interests are in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithms, complexity theory, and computational social choice.
