  This paper addresses the division of homogeneous divisible goods among agents with non-linear valuations. We propose an algorithm that guarantees a \(\frac{1}{2n-1}\)-MMS allocation for \(n\) agents with arbitrary non-decreasing valuations and establish the impossibility of exceeding a \(1/n\)-MMS approximation, even with one-breakpoint piecewise-constant valuations. For \(n \leq 3\), the \(1/n\) ratio is proven tight. On envy-freeness, we show that verifying the existence of an EF and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation is NP-hard for \(n\) agents and at least three goods, even with one-breakpoint piecewise-constant valuations. We complement this with a polynomial-time algorithm for checking EF and PO allocations for a single divisible good with piecewise-linear valuations.
