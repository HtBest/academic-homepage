  This paper presents piecewise analysis, a new general method that analyzes the running time of branching algorithms. We reanalyze two 17-year-old algorithms from Fomin et al. (2007) that solve 4-Coloring and #3-Coloring and we improve their running time from \(O(1.7272^n)\) to \(O(1.7207^n)\) and from \(O(1.6262^n)\) to \(O(1.6225^n)\) respectively.
