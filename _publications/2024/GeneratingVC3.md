    In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for solving the Vertex Cover problem on subcubic graphs in \(O(1.1313^k)\), beating the previous best running time of \(O(1.1442^k)\) due to Harris and Narayanaswamy (2022). We achieve this by combining two contributions of independent interest: 1) developing a new framework for the automated design of branching algorithms based on the idea of case analysis of local structures, and 2) introducing an extension of Measure & Conquer to randomized branching algorithms.
